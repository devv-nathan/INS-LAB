# Caesar-Cipher
This Python script implements a simple Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a numerical key. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
Encryption: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using a specified key.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the same key.

## Working
- Input: The user is prompted to enter a plaintext message and a numerical key.
- Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by the key value. For example, if the key is 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
- Decryption: The process is reversed to retrieve the original message.

## Steps to run the code:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a plaintext message when prompted.
3. Enter a numerical key (e.g., 3).
4. The script will display the encrypted message and then the decrypted message.
