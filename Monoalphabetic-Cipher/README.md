# Monoalphabetic Cipher
This Python program implements a monoalphabetic cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a predefined cipher key.You can experiment with different plaintext messages to see how they are encrypted and decrypted using the defined cipher key.

## Working
- Encryption: The script takes a plaintext message and converts it to uppercase. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from the cipher key.
- Decryption: The script takes the encrypted message and replaces each letter with the corresponding letter from the original alphabet.

## Steps to run the program
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the plaintext message you want to encrypt.
3. The script will display the encrypted message and then the decrypted message.
